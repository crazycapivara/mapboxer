`mapboxer` makes [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/),
an open source JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render interactive maps,
available within R via the [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) package.

## Note

`mapboxer` provides bindings to v1.x.x of Mapbox GL JS, which is under the 3-Clause BSD license. See also [breaking changes in Mapbox GL JS v2.0.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

## Installation

Install the release version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

```r
install.packages("mapboxer")
```

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("crazycapivara/mapboxer")
```

## Usage

```{r examples}
library(mapboxer)

map <- motor_vehicle_collisions_nyc %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    color = ifelse(injured == 0, "yellow", "red")
  ) %>%
  as_mapbox_source() %>%
  mapboxer(
    center = c(-73.9165, 40.7114),
    zoom = 10
  ) %>%
  add_navigation_control() %>%
  add_circle_layer(
    circle_color = c("get", "color"),
    circle_blur = 1,
    circle_stroke_color = "red",
    circle_stroke_width = 1,
    popup = "<p>{{date}} {{time}}</p><p>Number of persons injured: {{injured}}</p>"
  )

if (interactive()) map
```

By default mapboxer uses [Carto vector styles](https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles)
as basemaps. It is also possible to use raster tiles or a background color.

If you want to use styles from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/maps) it is recommended that you store your API token in an environment variable called `MAPBOX_API_TOKEN`.
