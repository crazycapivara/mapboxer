[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/mapboxer)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mapboxer) [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crazycapivara/mapboxer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crazycapivara/mapboxer) [![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active) <!-- badges: end -->

The mapboxer R library makes [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/), an open source JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render interactive maps, available within R via the [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) package. You only need a Mapbox access token if you want to use styles from Mapbox. By default mapboxer uses [Carto vector styles](https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles) as basemaps and it is also possible to use raster tiles or a background color.

Installation
------------

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("crazycapivara/mapboxer")
```

Usage
-----

``` r
library(mapboxer)

map <- quakes %>%
  as_mapbox_source(lng = "long", lat = "lat") %>%
  mapboxer(center = c(176.9, -24.655), zoom = 4) %>%
  add_navigation_control() %>%
  add_circle_layer(
    circle_color = "blue",
    circle_blur = 1,
    circle_stroke_color = "red",
    circle_stroke_width = 1,
    popup = "Magnitude: {{mag}}"
